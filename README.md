## Overview
This repository presents my solution to the Frontend Mentor QR code component challenge. Frontend Mentor challenges provide a platform for honing front-end development skills by tackling real-world projects. The challenge involved creating a responsive QR code component using HTML and CSS.

In this project, I focused on mobile-first design principles to ensure a seamless user experience across a range of devices, from mobile phones to larger desktop screens. The solution employs semantic HTML markup, CSS custom properties (variables), and layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve a responsive and visually appealing design.

I conducted thorough cross-browser compatibility testing to verify that the component functions consistently and looks as intended across various web browsers.

Through this challenge, I deepened my understanding of responsive web design, strengthened my HTML and CSS skills, and honed my problem-solving abilities. This project serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field of front-end development. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions for further enhancements.
